Overall Summary

Strongly predictable soil properties include SOC, total C, nitrogen, pH, CEC, EC, 
texture, water retention, and Fe/Al oxides. These match known MIR/VisNIR spectroscopy 
performance globally.

Moderately predictable properties include bulk density, WR10/33/1500, and 
available water capacity.

Weakly predictable properties include extractable nutrients (P, K, Mg, Na), 
consistent with soil spectroscopy literature, which notes these nutrients have 
weak or indirect spectral signatures.

These results confirm that the per-target OSSL-style training pipeline is functioning 
correctly and achieving performance in line with published soil spectroscopy benchmarks.
